<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>We're a (real, existent) group of enthusiasts located in
North Queensland, Australia.  We're dedicated to technology 
associated with the Python programming language. We meet, we talk,
we socialise, and on occasion, learn something new.  Currently meeting
in Townsville but join us from anywhere (even outside of NQ!).</p>
