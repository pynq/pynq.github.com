Our next social gathering will be as follows:

    | Riverview Tavern, Douglas - in Townsville
    | 6.30pm, Wednesday 16 October 2013
    | Meeting for dinner, drinks and tech talk.
    | Discussions on what, where, and when next - bring your ideas!

If you're unsure where this is, check out the location on 
`Google Maps <http://goo.gl/PN9lY>`_.

Hope to see you there!  Make sure you tell your friends and help
get them interested.  

Beyond this session, we'll aim to fix a regular meeting time and place,
especially where we have projectors, Internet access, and can start looking
at the nuts-and-bolts of programming in Python.  Because of the wide
gamut of people out there, we'll do some introductory-level discussions,
as well as some higher-level talks about frameworks and types of programming.
If you've got suggestions, come along and make them!

In any case, stay tuned to the blog and mailing list for more information.
See `about us <|filename|pages/about.rst>`_ for more information or the
