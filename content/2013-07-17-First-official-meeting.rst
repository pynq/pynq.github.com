Feel free to distribute this information far and wide if you're interested.
You can also obtain a `higher-resolution <|filename|images/first-meeting.png>`_ image for the poster if you'd like to print it on A4 and stick it up around
the place.

You can find the original artwork in the repository used for this blog -
see `about us <|filename|pages/about.rst>`_ for more information.

Hope to see you there!  Make sure you tell your friends and help
get them interested.  If you can't make it to this one, the aim is to hold
some form of semi-regular get-together (perhaps every month or so).  In
any case, stay tuned to the blog and mailing list for more information.
